# vimux

Easily interact with tmux from vim.

## Foreward
This is my own fork of vimux which internally makes use of pane IDs rather than indexes meaning that commands always go to the same pane regardless of any changes made to the tmux window.

What inspired me to write vimux was [tslime.vim](https://github.com/kikijump/tslime.vim), a plugin that lets you send input to tmux. While tslime.vim works well, I felt it wasn't optimized for my primary use case which was having a smaller tmux pane that I would use to run tests or play with a REPL.

My goal with vimux is to make interacting with tmux from vim effortless. By default when you call `VimuxRunCommand` vimux will create a 20% tall horizontal pane under your current tmux pane and execute a command in it without losing focus of vim. Once that pane exists whenever you call `VimuxRunCommand` again the command will be executed in that pane. As I was using vimux myself I wanted to rerun commands over and over. An example of this was running the current file through rspec. Rather than typing that over and over I wrote `VimuxRunLastCommand` that will execute the last command you called with `VimuxRunCommand`.

Other auxiliary functions and the ones I talked about above can be found bellow with a full description and example key binds for your vimrc.

## Installation

- With **[pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)**: `cd ~/.vim/bundle && git clone https://github.com/myinitialsarepm/vimux.git`
